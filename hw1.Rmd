# Instructions

## Introduction
This assignment will focus on the skills you have been developing in R over the first few weeks of this class. It will cover the materials on data structures and the fundamentals of R programming. Most of the content should be familiar but you will encounter some new functions. Recall that you can use the ``Help`` tab to find out more information about anything you are unsure about. The assignment will also help to build familiarity with RStudio, RMarkdown, and Github.

This assignment will involve a combination of short written answers and coding in R. All answers should be written in this document.

**Please begin by adding your name to the top of the document on line 3.**

## Requirements
You should be viewing this document in RStudio. If you have not done so already, make sure to install the required packages, listed above. You can do this by clicking the ``Install`` button in the Packages tab in the lower-right corner of RStudio and following the directions on the installation menu. You can also install packages by entering ``install.packages(x)`` into the R Console, where ``x`` is the name of the package.

## Formatting
This RMarkdown file contains a mixture of text (formatted using Markdown conventions) and R code "chunks". Each chunk is surrounded by triplets of backticks and begins with a set of braces with some important information, e.g. ``{r setup, include=FALSE}``. First, the ``r`` signifies that the chunk should be run using R. This is followed by the the name of the chunk. After the comma there is a set of options, separated by commas. In this case ``include=FALSE`` means that this code chunk will not be shown in documents we create using this file. If we set it to ``TRUE`` then the chunk would be printed in any output.

In (lines 9-21) there are also some global options that alter the behavior of all code chunks, although we can override these options for an individual chunk. Look at the documentation [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options) for further explanation of the different options. 

You can execute the code in a chunk by clicking the green arrow in the top right (``Run Current Chunk``) or by using the keyboard shortcut.* You can also run individual lines by selecting the line or clicking at the beginning and using the keyboard shortcut.

*``Alt + Shift + K`` or ``Option + Shift + K``, depending upon your computer, will open up a menu showing the keyboard shortcuts available in RStudio.

## Submitting the homework
Once you have finished the assignment please complete the following steps to submit it:

1. Click on the ``Knit`` menu at the top of the screen and select ``Knit to HTML``. This will execute the all of the code and render the RMarkdown document in HTML. Verify that this document contains all of your answers and that none of the chunks produce error messages.
2. Add this document *and* the HTML file to Github. Use ``Homework submitted`` as your main commit message.
3. Push the commit to Github.
4. Visit the Github repository in your browser and verify that the final version of both files has been correctly uploaded.

#  Questions

Q1. For each of the following chunk options, explain what they do in one sentence (refer to the documentation linked in the previous section):

    a. echo:
    b. warning:
    c. message:
    d. tidy:
    e. error:
    
Q2. Use the ``Insert a new code chunk`` button (or the keyboard shortcut) to insert a new chunk below this paragraph. Add the option ``echo=FALSE``. Once you have created the chunk, create three variables: a character string, an integer, and a logical. You are free to choose the value of the variables and can name them anything you like. This chunk should not show in the final HTML document.

Q3. In the chunk below, create a vector of numbers from 1 to 100, reverse the order of the vector, and print the last 5 values (e.g. 96, 97, 98, 99, 100). 

```{r q3, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}

```

Q4. Complete the code chunk below. Assign the first and last elements of the vector created in Q3 to the relevant names then print each object out using the ``print`` function.

```{r q4, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
first <- 
last <- 
print(first+last)
```

Q5. a. Create a vector ``v`` of 10,000 values drawn from a normal distribution then calculate the mean and standard deviation using built-in functions. Then uncomment the last two lines to print the values, rounded to two decimal places.
```{r q5a, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
v <- 
v.mean <-
v.sd <- 
print(round(v.mean), 2)
print(round(v.sd), 2)
```

Q5. b. Now create a new vector ``v.2`` of the same length as ``v``, where the mean and standard deviation are approximately equal. You may need to use the ``help`` command to find out how to do this.
```{r q5b, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
v.2 <- 
v.2.mean <-
v.2.sd <- 
print(round(v.2.mean), 2)
print(round(v.2.sd), 2)
```

Q6. Combine the two vectors from Q5 into a matrix with 10,000 rows and 2 columns. Print the first ten rows of the matrix using the ``head`` function.
```{r q6, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}

```

Q7. a. Convert the matrix from Q6 into a data frame. Use the ``colnames`` function to assign the names ``x`` and ``y`` to the columns. 
```{r q7a, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}

```

Q7. b. Next, use the ``$`` operator to select column ``y`` and print the twenty highest values.
```{r q7b, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}

```

Q8. This question will focus on lists. In the example below we have conducted a series of flips of a fair coin and stored the results, along with some other information in a list. Don't modify the first two lines of the chunk or use the object ``t`` in any of your code.

a. Print the first ten elements of the ``trials`` element of ``q`` using only the square brackets notation for list indexing and selecting the relevant elements.

b. Do the same but make use of the ``$`` operator. Note that you may still need to use square brackets to index specific elements of
``trials``. 

c. Print the value of the variance of ``trials``, as stored in the ``stats`` element.

d. Add the ``trials`` element as a new column in the data frame you created in Q6.
```{r q8, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
t <- rbinom(10000,1,0.50)
q <- list(trials = t, desc="10k_trials", timestamp = date(), stats = c(mean(t), var(t)))
#### Your code for 8a-d here
```

Q9. In the example below, you will find a list to store information about various fruit. The ``unlist`` command can be used to convert from a list to a vector. 

a. Find out the class of ``v``. In one sentence explain why it belongs to this class given that the list consisted of both character and numeric content.

b. You will notice that this vector contains names, corresponding to the original element name and the position of the value in the original vector. You can use these names, along with square brackets notation, to extract specific elements from the vector. Use this method to print out the number of pineapples. Note that this does not prevent you from using standard positional indexing.
```{r q9, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
fruit.count <- list(fruits=c("apples", "oranges", "pineapples"), counts=c(9, 4, 3))
v <- unlist(fruit.count)
#### Your code here 9a-b
```

Q10. In the following chunk we use a for-loop and an if-else statement to sort the letters in the alphabet into vowels and consonants. Complete the missing code between the parentheses. You may need to use the help function (``?append``) to see how the append function works.
```{r q10, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
letters <- LETTERS
vowels <- character()
consonants <- character()

for () { # complete the code in the parentheses
    if () { # complete the conditional
        vowels <- append() # provide arguments to append()
    } else {
        consonants <- append() # provide arguments to append()
    }
}
```

Q11. Let's try using these vowels and consonants to create some new words using a very simple set of morphological rules. Each word is ``N`` letters long. We start by randomly picking a consonant, followed by a vowel, then complete remainder of the word by following two simple rules: if the previous two characters are the same type (e.g. both consonants), pick a different type (e.g. a vowel); if the two previous letters are different types then pick any letter at random. 

Complete the for-loop and the conditional statements in the code below. You may need to use the ``%in%`` operator for the conditionals, see usage below. I have included a series of print statements to help to show what the code is doing. The ``paste`` function is used to combine the letters in a character vector into a single character string.
```{r q11, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
N = 6 # word length 

word <- character() # this will hold our words
word[1] <- sample(consonants, 1) # sample 1 consonant at random
word[2] <- tolower(sample(vowels, 1)) # Note the lowercase function

word[1] %in% consonants # verify 1st letter is consonant
word[2] %in% vowels # verify 2nd is a vowel

for (i in ) { # complete the code in the parentheses
    
     print(i) # print the current index
     print(paste(word, collapse="")) # print current word
     
     if () { # complete the conditional
         word[i] <- tolower(sample(consonants, 1))
     } else if () { # complete the conditional
         word[i] <- tolower(sample(vowels, 1))
     } else {
         word[i] <- tolower(sample(LETTERS, 1))
     }
    print(paste(word, collapse="")) # word with one more letter
}
```

Q12. If we want to re-use the code in Q11 then it is useful to make a function. Complete the code below to construct a function to output a random word of length N, following the same rules as before. The function must return a single word (i.e. not a vector of characters). When you have finished the function, please remove all print statements from the function body.
```{r q12, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
make.word <- function(N) {
    #### Your function body here
    
    return() # Complete the return statement
}

print(make.word(8))
print(make.word(10)) # run this to print a 10 letter word
``` 

Q13. Here we are calculating the standard deviation of a normally-distributed random variable ``X``. Use the pipe operator (``%>%``) to re-write this nested set of functions, assigning the output to ``sd.piped``. *Note that you may need to supply arguments to some of the functions in the pipe.* The statements at the end should return ``TRUE``, verifying that the output of the nested code, the pipe, and the built-in standard deviation function all match.
```{r q13, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
N <- 10000
X <- rnorm(N)

sd.nested <- sqrt(sum(((X-mean(X))^2))/(N-1))

sd.piped <- # your pipe goes here

sd.nested == sd.piped & sd.piped == sd(X)

```

This is the end of the assignment. Please follow the submission instructions at the beginning of this document.
